        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Pulled from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/261159/cream-of-chicken-and-artichoke-soup" rel="noreferrer">Allrecipies.com</a>, this recipe appears to be user submitted DIY of a recipe from the Cheesecake Factory
            </p>
            <p>I have not tried the original nor the DIY version as I am too destitute to dine at the Cheesecake Factory and not much of a cook. However, if I were to give up learning to code and instead take up cooking, I imagine this would be something I might try to make. Chicken in good. Artichokes are good. Its a no-brainer.

            <ul>
                <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>

                <li>1 small carrot, diced</li>
                <li>1 celery stalk, diced</li>
                <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
                <li>1/4 cup mushrooms, chopped</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
                <li>1/2 cup white cooking wine</li>
                <li>2 fully cooked chicken breasts, cut into bite size pieces</li>
                <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat chicken broth and water in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Squeeze lemon juice in and stir. Cook for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a grill pan over medium-high heat. Add red bell pepper; grill until somewhat soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer red bell pepper to the stockpot; add tomatoes, artichokes, potato, carrot, celery, green onions, mushrooms, and garlic. Increase heat to high. Bring to a boil; cook until vegetables are soft, about 15 minutes. Stir in cream and wine.</li>
                <li>Fill blender halfway with the vegetable-broth mixture. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to puree. Pour into a separate pot. Repeat with remaining vegetable-broth mixture.</li>
                <li>Pour all the pureed mixture back into the original stockpot; add chicken and black pepper. Heat over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
