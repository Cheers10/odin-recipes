        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This is a recipe taken from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/60449/cheesy-grilled-cheese/" rel="noreferrer">allrecipes.com</a>. It appears to be a pretty simple sandwhich. I think all three of the cheeses are acceptable without passing into "fancy grilled cheese" territory. However, the base is rye bread, which I think is just lunacy.</p>
            <p>To be completley transparent, I originally intended to use exclusively soup recipes for this site, but as it turns out, soup has a lot of ingredients! So this recipe was chosen for its small number of ingredients. While I appreciate the practice of the unordered list, after the fourth list item, I'm like, "yeah, I get it."</p>
            <p>Also, the original recipe titles this sandwhich, <cite>"Cheesy Grilled Cheese"</cite>. I find the redundancy infuriating and, thusly, have omitted it for my purposes here.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
                <li>1 slice cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1 slice muenster cheese</li>
                <li>1 slice provolone cheese</li>
                <li>2 slices <em>rye bread</em></li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven's broiler.</li>
                <li>Butter one side of each slice of bread, and place butter side down on a baking sheet. Place cheese slices on top of each piece of bread.</li>
                <li>Broil until cheese is bubbly and slightly brown. Remove from the oven, and press the two pieces of bread together cheese to cheese.</li>
            </ol>
