        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Okay, so hear me out. I know this is not a soup recipe as I originally intended. It is indeed a short list of ingredients, but that's not why I choose it either. I chose this recipe for my dad, who loved popcorn.</p>
            <p> This recipe is also taken from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/87305/microwave-popcorn/" rel="nonreferrer">allrecipes.com</a>. It doesn't have any functional value to me as I have found and made use of my dad's air popper, which we used when I was a kid. Maybe it's becuases the air popper takes up quite a bit of counter space or just doesn't keep up in speed and convenience, but, in his old age, my father preferred microwae popcorn. I don't have any packs of it in the kitchen I inherited from him, but I do have the "brown paper lunch sack" as listed in the instructions. My father's purpose in keeping such a sack is mysterious, as he preferred to keep his lunch in a cooler.</p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 cup unpopped popcorn</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Directions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Mix together unpopped popcorn and oil in a cup or small bowl.</li>
                    <li>Pour the coated corn into a brown paper lunch sack, and sprinkle in the salt. Fold the top of the bag over twice to seal in the ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Cook in the microwave at full power for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes, or until you hear pauses of about 2 seconds between pops. Carefully open the bag to avoid steam, and pour into a serving bowl.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
