# odin-recipes
This is my first project for The Odin Project. It is a simple site built to display recipes. It has, so far, been a great review for the git and github skills. I plan to return here to list other strengthened skills.

I've decided to use this document as a semi-live learning journal. The git commit process seems like it will take a few more practice gos to really get down. 

Index, first recipe page, and link between the two added. The HTML boilerplate is going quite quickly. I'm worried that I am committing too much, and that my commits are not specific enough. I think I should re-read the commit lesson. 

Re-read a resource and am feeling a bit more empowered to make single line commits, which I think may be all that is  necessary for this project. I will have to dive a little deeper to achieve the subject/body format later. 

Alright, after the first recipe page has been completed I am feeling pretty good about the html skills. Strengthened lists (ordered and unordered), links, and images. My commits are getting a little better, I think. The git workflow is making a bit more sense, in a learn-by-doing kind of way, but I'm afraid this first project out may be a little bit sloppy presentationally. Evidence of the learning curve, I suppose. Looking forward to adding the other two pages. 

Today I fixed a few errors, one wherein I used "eng" instead of "en" for the English lang attribute. Also, I added forgotten nonrefferer tags to my absolute links. I think the project is mostly done now. Tomorrow I will check for typos and complete. I'll be interested to see the project from the github view. I'm worried my commits are nonsense. 

Final thoughts: I can git push more. There was a finality to it that I found alarming, but I could have seen and adjusted my commit strategy earlier. There is a probably a way to do this without the push, I'm hoping to bump into it down the line. My commits did not end up being nonsense, i think. They are simple and still probably have some ignorant, semantic issues, but thats alright for now. Overall, this exercise was super duper necessary for me to wrap my head around the git workflow. 

The HTML came pretty easily for me, but the practice was certainly necessary. I have some formatting inconsistencies, which I may attempt to sort out with google in the future, specifically in the chicken and artichoke page. As a spectator, I like my silly, little page pretty good.
