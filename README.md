# odin-recipes
This is my first project for The Odin Project. It is a simple site built to display recipes. It has, so far, been a great review for the git and github skills. I plan to return here to list other strengthened skills.

I've decided to use this document as a semi-live learning journal. The git commit process seems like it will take a few more practice gos to really get down.
