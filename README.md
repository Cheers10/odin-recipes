# odin-recipes
This is my first project for The Odin Project. It is a simple site built to display recipes. It has, so far, been a great review for the git and github skills. I plan to return here to list other strengthened skills.

I've decided to use this document as a semi-live learning journal. The git commit process seems like it will take a few more practice gos to really get down. 

Index, first recipe page, and link between the two added. The HTML boilerplate is going quite quickly. I'm worried that I am commiting too much, and that my commits are not specific enough. I think I should re-read the commit lesson. 

Re-read a resource and am feeling a bit more empowered to make single line commits, which I think may be all that is  necessary for this project. I will have to dive a little deeper to achieve the subject/body format later.
